## Note
All work done within two Jupyter notebooks:
- **For EDA:**<br/>
  1- [Victim Relationship Cleaning](https://github.com/amjadalth/Predicting-Victim-Relasionship-Classification-Project/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Victim%20Relationship%20Cleaning.ipynb)<br/>
  
- **For Classification:** <br/>
  2- [Best_Model_Selection]()<br/>

The two notebooks depend on each other so, they should be run sequentially as they number.
